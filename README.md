# OWL-Protege-Medieval

The Ontology presents the Society of the Middle Ages, their hierarchy, the power and influence of each class from the lowest to the highest.
The Ontology can be used to compare other areas that have a Monarchy and a different hierarchy.
So it will be possible to answer any kind of question concerning the comparison between Monarchies and any kind of research question about the power 
that the classes had then in relation to some other time period or other area.
Comparison and combination of features can occur using the inference mechanism.
